# client/ (React + Vite)

- Use the existing Stack (React + Vite + TypeScript) and component patterns (shadcn/ui, Radix).
- Prefer small, focused changes to pages and components; follow existing layout and routing structure.
- Run `npm run dev` for local development and `npm run test` / `npm run check` when touching critical logic.
