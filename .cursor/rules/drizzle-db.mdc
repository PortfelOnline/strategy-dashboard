# drizzle/ (DB schema & migrations)

- Treat `drizzle/schema.ts` and migrations as the single source of truth for the DB structure.
- Keep migrations small and additive; avoid destructive changes unless explicitly intended and documented.
- Coordinate schema updates with backend code changes and update any relevant docs.
